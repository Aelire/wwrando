This models folder is for custom player models that allow you to play the game as other characters.
Players models placed in this folder will appear in the randomizer's "Player Customization" tab.

The randomizer itself does not come with any models. You can download them separately from here:
https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/Custom-Wind-Waker-Player-Models

After you've downloaded a ZIP file with some models, use the "Install a Custom Model or Model Pack" button in the randomizer's "Player Customization" tab to install the models.
If you selected the right file, you should now be able to select the new models in the randomizer.

Alternatively, you can install models without using the button by extracting them into this models folder.
If you did it correctly, the models folder should have several different folders in it, each with a different character name.
Each of those folders should have a file called Link.arc in it, as well as several other files such as metadata.txt.
